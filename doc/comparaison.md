For the project, we are going to use two DBMS: 

- a **relational** database to store client credentials (identifiants, passwords)

| MongoDB                                                      | Redis                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| BSON Model (Binary JSON): More efficient for storing data or transmitting over a network | Key value store (key=value), so globally strings             |
| Query documents by single or multiple keys, ranges, or text search | Limited query functionality. By design-only primary key access |
| On-disk storage by default                                   | In-memory storage with on-disk persistence                   |
